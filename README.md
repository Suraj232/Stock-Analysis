Refactored time for year 2017
## 3.) Advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
One of the main advantages is we can reduce the macro run time. As we can see in images the refactored code (.109 seconds) took one third of the time taken by the original code (.305 seconds). 
## 4) Pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VB script?
### 4.1) Pros of refactoring the original VB script:
It makes look code more readable and cleaner. If some other user wants to look into the code, being very concise it makes easy to understand.
Secondly refactoring makes code more efficient to run and easy to debug.
### 4.1) Cons of Refactoring:
One of the cons is indefinite refactoring could lead to new bugs in the existing code.
